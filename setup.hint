ldesc: "Generate random signature from a set of rules. Each rule section can
be one of an unlimited number of possibilities, each with its own
weighting so those really cool quotes can appear more often than
others. Sections can also be placed next o each other vertically to
create columns. Each section can be formatted independently as
left/right/center and top/bottom/vcenter."
